# Commit Guidelines

- Write descriptive commit messages
- Follow the conventional commits format:
  - feat: New feature
  - fix: Bug fix
  - docs: Documentation changes
  - style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - refactor: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - perf: Performance improvements
  - test: Add or modify tests
  - chore: Changes to build process or tools
- Include ticket/issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single feature or fix
- Squash multiple related commits before merging to main branch

Remember to maintain consistent branding and user experience according to the project's design guidelines.
