Workflow Preferences

Task Execution:

Focus only on code relevant to the task; !you never touch unrelated code.
Break complex tasks into logical stages; pause and ask for confirmation before next step.
For simple, low-risk tasks, implement fully; for complex tasks, use review checkpoints.

Planning and Progress:

Before major features, generate plan.md with steps and wait for my approval.
After each component, summarize what’s done in progress.md and update TODO.txt with next steps.
If context exceeds 100k tokens, summarize prior work into context-summary.md and restart chat.

Testing and Feedback:

Write thorough tests for all major functionality; suggest edge case tests.
Be responsive to my feedback—adjust granularity (more/less checkpoints) as I prefer.
