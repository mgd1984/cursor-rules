# OWASP Agents Checklist

## Memory Poisoning
**Description:** Prevent memory poisoning attacks by implementing validation, session isolation, and anomaly detection.
**Severity:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Enforce memory content validation.
- Implement session-based isolation for short-term memory.
- Use AI-generated memory snapshots for forensic rollback.

## Tool Misuse
**Description:** Prevent AI tool misuse by restricting execution privileges and monitoring tool invocations.
**Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- Restrict AI tool access with granular permissions.
- Monitor AI tool usage patterns and validate function calls.
- Enforce execution logs and anomaly detection for tool usage.

## Privilege Compromise
**Description:** Mitigate unauthorized privilege escalation in AI agents.
**Severity:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Implement strict RBAC and ABAC for agent permissions.
- Dynamically validate access requests in real-time.
- Restrict cross-agent privilege delegation.

## Cascading Hallucinations
**Description:** Prevent cascading misinformation from propagating across AI agents.
**Severity:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Implement multi-source validation and probabilistic truth-checking.
- Require secondary validation before using AI-generated knowledge.
- Deploy feedback loops to correct AI knowledge errors.

## Intent Manipulation
**Description:** Prevent AI agent goal manipulation and misaligned behaviors.
**Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- Apply behavioral constraints on agent autonomy.
- Enforce AI reasoning validation before executing critical tasks.
- Deploy AI auditing tools to detect deviations in behavior.

## Identity Spoofing
**Description:** Prevent AI identity spoofing and unauthorized impersonation.
**Severity:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Enforce cryptographic identity verification for AI agents.
- Deploy continuous monitoring for impersonation attempts.
- Use behavioral profiling to detect anomalies in AI activity.

## Agent Communication Poisoning
**Description:** Prevent manipulation of multi-agent system communications.
**Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- Use cryptographic message authentication for inter-agent communications.
- Monitor inter-agent interactions for anomalies.
- Require multi-agent consensus verification for high-risk operations.

## Rogue Agents
**Description:** Prevent unauthorized AI agents from executing malicious actions.
**Severity:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Restrict AI autonomy using strict policy constraints.
- Enforce continuous behavioral monitoring.
- Implement controlled hosting environments with strict access control.

## Human Manipulation
**Description:** Prevent AI-driven manipulation of human users.
**Severity:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor AI interactions for deceptive behaviors.
- Restrict tool access to limit attack surface.
- Deploy validation mechanisms for AI-generated outputs.

## Resource Overload
**Description:** Mitigate AI system resource exhaustion and degradation attacks.
**Severity:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Deploy adaptive resource scaling mechanisms.
- Monitor system load in real-time for overload attempts.
- Implement AI rate-limiting policies to restrict excessive task execution.
